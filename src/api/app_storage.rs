    /// Since these locations may contain files created by other Tauri plugins or webview systems, 
    /// it is recommended to add a subdirectory with a unique name.
    ///
    /// If you are unsure between this function and [`PrivateStorage::resolve_path`] with [`PrivateDir::Data`] or [`PrivateDir::Cache`],
    /// you don’t need to use this one.  
    /// The difference from it is that these files may be accessed by user or other apps that have permissions,
    /// and it cannot always be available since removable storage can be ejected.  
    /// 
    /// One advantage of using this is that it allows storing large app-specific data/cache on SD cards or other supplementary storage, 
    /// which can be useful on older devices with limited built-in storage capacity. 
    /// However on modern devices, the built-in storage capacity is relatively large,
    /// and there is little advantage in using this.  
    /// 
    /// By using [`StorageVolume { is_emulated, .. }`](StorageVolume), 
    /// you can determine whether this belongs to the same storage volume as [`PrivateStorage::resolve_path`]. 
    /// If it is `true`, there is no advantage in using this instead of [`PrivateStorage::resolve_path`]. 
    /// It only reduces security.
    /// 
    /// ### About AppDir::PublicMedia
    /// This is a location for storing media files shared with other apps nad user on older versions of Android. 
    /// For Android 11 (API level 30) or higher, 
    /// it has been marked as deprecated. 
    /// It still works, but you should consider migrating to [`PublicStorage`].
    /// 
    /// This is a location that is unfamiliar to the user, 
    /// but calling [`AppStorage::scan_public_media_by_path`] will make it 
    /// displayed in a more user-friendly way in gallery apps and file managers.  
    /// 
    /// For file in this directory, do not use operations such as rename or remove that rely on paths 
    /// (including URIs obtained via [`FileUri::from_path`] with this paths), 
    /// as they may break consistency with the MediaStore on old version.
